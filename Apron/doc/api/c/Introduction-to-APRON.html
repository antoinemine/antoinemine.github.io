<p>The APRON library provides a common interface for <em class="emph">abstract
domains of invariants</em> for numerical variables, in the sense of the
Abstract Interpretation theory. It includes a few domains, and
provides interfaces to libraries implemented by other teams.
</p>

<p>Several libraries already exists, wich implement various abstract domains of
invariants.  One can cite intervals, linear equalities, octagons,
octahedra, convex polyhedra, polynomial equalities, polynomial
inequalities. Although they offer a kernel of common functionalities,
their API may differ greatly, and some functionalities may lack in some
libraries. The aim of the APRON library is to offer a common interface to these
libraries. Such a standardized interface offers several advantages: it allows
</p><ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>to easily
substitute a library/abstract domain by another in the same analysis
tool; this is useful to compare the efficiency of 2 implementations of
the same abstract domain, or the precision of 2 different abstract
domains.
</li><li>to factorize services which are mostly independant of the abstract
domain (variables management, linearization of non-linear expressions,
etc...);
</li><li>to make easier the combination of abstract domains: the abstract
domains to be combined are used through the same interface, as the
resulting combination;
</li></ul>

<h4 class="subsubheading" id="As-a-user_002c-why-should-I-use-APRON-_003f"><span>As a user, why should I use APRON ?<a class="copiable-link" href="#As-a-user_002c-why-should-I-use-APRON-_003f"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> it makes very easy to switch the abstract domain (for numerical
variables) in use in an analyzer;
</li><li> it already offers the most used abstract domains, ranging from
intervals, octagons, convex polyhedra to linear congruences;
</li><li> its interface should satisfy most needs, as it already satisfies the
members of the APRON project working in different contexts
(verification of high-level specifications/programs with exact
arithmetics for INRIA \&amp; Verimag, static analysis of runtime errors
with floating-point arithmetics for ENS Paris, automatic
parallelization of programs for ENSMP).
</li><li> the interface, at the level 1, already provides slightly higher-level
functionalities than most existing and publicy available abstract
domains libraries (with the manipulation of environments); this
statement should be reinforced in the near future with the planned
addition of a generic non-linear expressions layer and a
floating-point arithmetic layer.

<li> to incite existing users of the APRON interface to try your library;
</li><li> to make your users, including yourself, benefit from previous points 1 and 4;
</li><li> to not waste your time implementing environments, variables renaming,
OCaml interfaces, and so on; the effort to connect your library to the
interface should at minimum be counterbalanced by such gains;
